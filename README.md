# Second Order Analog Filters

This repo contains some empty jupyter notebooks for students. 

Each notebook describes a particular analog second order filter (RC-RC, RLC, Rauch, Sallen-Key). Then, the objective is to create two python functions :

* compute_parameters : this function compute the filter specifications from the filter components
* select_components : this function select the filter components from some filter specifications
